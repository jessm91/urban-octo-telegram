# urban-octo-telegram

For this project, I was required to clean up the code on a webpage for a search engine optimization company named Horiseon.
In the HTML file I had to change a few elements, clean up the structure, add alt atributes to the images, set up correct headings, and give the page a title.
In the CSS file, I had to combine several class selectors so that there wasn't unnecessary repetition.

The commits for this project were saved to the repository.
